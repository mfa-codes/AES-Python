# AES-Python

This is a smaller short code for the AES encryption method. This code I wrote completely in Python. 
The file "AES.py" contains the methods for encryption and decryption. 
The file "main.py" uses the methods and starts the program.


Please be sure to install the needed libraries in the terminal with 
"pip(3) install pycrypto" and "pip(3) install pycopy-binascii".
